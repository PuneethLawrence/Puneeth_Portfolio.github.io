I‚Äôm a cybersecurity and networking enthusiast with hands-on experience in network scanning, vulnerability assessment, and protocol analysis. Skilled in tools like Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, and Burp Suite, I bring a strong understanding of both offensive and defensive security. I hold CEH v12 and CCNA certifications, and I‚Äôm passionate about securing networks through practical testing and continuous learning.

# CCNA Projects

Network Simulation Labs (Cisco Packet Tracer & Virtual Machines)
Developed and deployed multiple network topologies and services in simulated environments to reinforce routing, switching, and security concepts. Key configurations include:

### Routing Protocols
Configured and verified OSPF, RIP, and EIGRP for dynamic routing in both single-area and multi-area topologies using Cisco Packet Tracer.

### Switching & Redundancy
Implemented STP, RSTP, PVST+, and RPVST+ to prevent switching loops and ensure Layer 2 redundancy across multiple switches.

### Device Discovery Protocols
Enabled and tested CDP and LLDP for network device discovery and topology validation in a simulated enterprise environment.

### First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRPs)
Configured HSRP, VRRP, and GLBP to ensure gateway redundancy and improve network availability.

### Network Time Protocol (NTP)
Deployed NTP servers and clients to synchronize clock settings across routers and switches for consistent logging and scheduling.

### DHCP Deployment
Set up DHCP servers, clients, and relay agents to manage IP address allocation dynamically across different VLANs and subnets.

### Domain Name System (DNS)
Configured DNS servers to provide domain-to-IP name resolution for internal devices in a virtual lab setup.

### Secure Remote Access (SSH)
Enabled SSH on routers and switches to allow secure remote management and configuration, replacing insecure Telnet access.

### Centralized Logging (Syslog)
Set up a Syslog server to collect logs from network devices for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

### Network Address Translation (NAT)
Configured Static, Dynamic, and PAT (Port Address Translation) NAT to enable private IP networks to access external resources.

### Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)
Simulated WLC deployment for managing SSIDs, access points, and wireless clients in a controlled environment.

### Layer 2 Security Features
Implemented Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) and DHCP Snooping to mitigate Layer 2 attacks and improve switch-level security.

# CEH projects

### Nessus Report

I used Nessus to scan a Windows 10 machine and identify potential vulnerabilities. After setting up the scan, I configured Nessus to perform a comprehensive network vulnerability assessment, targeting the machine‚Äôs open ports, services, and software configurations. The scan highlighted several issues, such as outdated software versions, missing security patches, and weak configurations, all of which could be exploited by attackers. Nessus provided detailed reports on each vulnerability, including their severity levels, and suggested remediation steps to mitigate the risks. This allowed me to gain a clear understanding of the security weaknesses in the Windows 10 system, helping me identify areas for improvement in its defenses.

### Exploiting and Gaining Access to a Machine

I exploited a Windows 7 machine using Kali Linux and a few tools like Metasploit, Nmap, and the EternalBlue vulnerability. First, I ran an Nmap scan on the target machine to check for open ports and services, which revealed that SMB (port 445) was active‚Äîthis was key for exploiting EternalBlue. Once I confirmed the machine was vulnerable, I used Metasploit and the exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue module to take advantage of the flaw. This allowed me to execute remote code on the system. After gaining access, I was able to run commands and potentially access sensitive data, which highlights the importance of patching known vulnerabilities to prevent attacks like this.
